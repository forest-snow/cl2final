Our project has 3 components: n-gram model, topic model, and RNN.

To run the topic model, run python slda.py. You have to change the pathfile in extract.py (instructions as comments at top of file) to where the reddit dataset is located.  You will also need to change output_file in slda.py to specify where you will like the output topic vectors.  Also, to be able to run slda.py, you will need to install package from https://github.com/dongwookim-ml/python-topic-model
